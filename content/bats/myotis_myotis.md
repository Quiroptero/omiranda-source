# Communal Roosts

The **Greater Mouse-eared Bat** (_Myotis myotis_) is known for its fascinating communal roosting behavior.
During the winter months, these bats hibernate in large groups,
often congregating in caves, abandoned mines, or other sheltered locations.
What makes this behavior particularly unique is the size of these roosting colonies.
Some colonies can consist of thousands to even tens of thousands of individuals
huddled together for warmth and protection.
These large gatherings not only help bats conserve energy during hibernation
but also foster social interactions within the group.
