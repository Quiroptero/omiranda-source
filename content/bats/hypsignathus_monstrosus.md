# Extraordinary Facial Structure

The **Hammer-headed Bat** (_Hypsignathus monstrosus_)
possesses one of the most extraordinary facial structures among bat species.
This bat has an exceptionally elongated and flattened head that resembles the shape of a hammer or mallet.
The elongated head houses a specialized echolocation system
that allows the Hammer-headed Bat to emit and receive ultrasonic calls with exceptional precision.
By utilizing this unique facial structure, the bat can detect and locate prey, such as insects and fruits,
even in dense forests or amidst cluttered environments.
