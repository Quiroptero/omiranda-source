# Distinctive Facial Folds

The **Wrinkle-faced Bat** (_Centurio senex_)
has a striking and unique facial feature that sets it apart from other bat species.
As its common name suggests,
this bat is distinguished by its prominent facial folds and furrows,
giving it an appearance that is quite unlike any other.

These facial folds are more pronounced in males and play a role in their social communication.
When communicating with each other, the males use their wrinkled faces to produce complex vocalizations,
which may serve in establishing territory or attracting potential mates.
However, the specific function of these facial folds is not entirely understood.
