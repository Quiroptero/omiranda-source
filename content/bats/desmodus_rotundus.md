# Blood-Eating Specialist

The **Common Vampire Bat** (_Desmodus rotundus_) 
is a blood-eating specialist and one of the three vampire bat species.
As a unique adaptation,
it has evolved heat sensors on its nose,
which allows it to detect warm-blooded animals, such as birds or mammals, from a distance.

Feeding exclusively on blood, the Common Vampire Bat uses its sharp incisor teeth to make small,
painless incisions on its prey while they sleep,
and then laps up the blood that oozes out.
Contrary to popular belief,
vampire bats do not drain a large amount of blood from their victims,
and their feeding behavior rarely poses a significant threat to livestock or humans.
