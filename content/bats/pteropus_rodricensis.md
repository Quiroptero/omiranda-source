# Seed Dispersal Specialist

The **Rodrigues Flying Fox** (_Pteropus rodricensis_)
is a fruit-eating bat that specializes in seed dispersal on the island of Rodrigues, where it is found.
After feasting on the fruits,
the bat disperses the seeds through its droppings as it flies to different locations.
This seed dispersal service is of immense importance for the island's vegetation.
By spreading seeds to new areas,
the bat contributes to forest regeneration and helps maintain healthy and diverse plant communities.
It also aids in the reforestation of degraded areas,
promoting the growth of native plants and supporting other wildlife that rely on these habitats.
However, the Rodrigues Flying Fox faces various threats, including habitat loss and hunting,
which have led to a decline in its population.
