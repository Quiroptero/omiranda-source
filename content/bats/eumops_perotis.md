# Insect-Hunting Powerhouse

The **Western Mastiff Bat** (_Eumops perotis_)
has evolved remarkable adaptations that make it an expert predator of insects.
Equipped with large, sensitive ears and excellent echolocation capabilities,
the Western Mastiff Bat can detect and pinpoint tiny insects with impressive accuracy,
even in complete darkness.

One of the bat's signature hunting techniques is called "gleaning."
Instead of catching insects mid-flight like many other bat species,
the Western Mastiff Bat excels at capturing insects directly from surfaces,
such as the ground, vegetation, or tree trunks.
It swiftly maneuvers to snatch up insects that are either crawling or resting,
making it an efficient ground-based forager.
As a result, these bats play a vital role in regulating insect populations,
helping to maintain ecological balance within their ecosystem.
