# Seed-Scattering Skills

The **Greater Short-nosed Fruit Bat** (_Cynopterus sphinx_)
is a remarkable fruit-eating specialist that plays a crucial role in seed dispersal.
This bat species primarily feeds on a variety of ripe fruits,
using its sharp teeth to puncture the skin and access the succulent pulp within.
As it consumes the fruit, the bat inadvertently ingests seeds,
which it later disperses through its droppings as it moves from one feeding site to another.
