# Nesting strategy: Living Leaf Tents

The **Honduran White Bat** (_Ectophylla alba_) is an exceptional bat species
renowned for its fascinating habit of selecting large leaves,
typically from plants like the Heliconia or Banana,
and then cutting the leaf veins without causing harm to the plant.
Once the veins are cut, the bat proceeds to fold the leaf into a neat and secure tent-like structure.
These living leaf tents serve as ingenious roosts for the bats,
offering protection from potential predators and harsh weather elements.

The Honduran White Bat often forms small,
close-knit groups,
usually consisting of a harem of females and their young offspring,
that share these cozy leaf tents as communal roosts.
Their vibrant white fur, tinged with yellow and sometimes green from the surrounding foliage,
further adds to their adorable and unique appearance.
