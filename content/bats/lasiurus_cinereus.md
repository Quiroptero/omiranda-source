# Elusive Nocturnal Wanderer

The **Hoary Bat** (_Lasiurus cinereus_) is the largest bat species in Canada and the United States.
This creature boasts an impressive wingspan and a distinctive frosted or "hoary" appearance,
thanks to its dense, multicolored fur.
Despite its substantial size, the Hoary Bat displays remarkable agility and flight prowess.
Some individuals have been observed traveling up to 1,500 miles during migration,
showcasing their resilience and adaptability.
However, the Hoary Bat remains a somewhat elusive and enigmatic creature.
As it tends to roost high up in trees during the day, hidden amidst dense foliage,
studying and observing this magnificent bat in its natural habitat
can be quite challenging for researchers and wildlife enthusiasts alike.
