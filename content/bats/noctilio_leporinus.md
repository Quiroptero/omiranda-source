# Specialized Fishing Bat

The **Greater Bulldog Bat** (_Noctilio leporinus_)
is an intriguing species known for its unique hunting behavior.
Unlike many other bats that primarily feed on insects,
this bat has developed a remarkable fishing technique.
When it detects the movement of a fish swimming near the water's surface,
it uses its sharp claws to catch the fish in its powerful hind legs,
while its tail membrane acts as a scoop,
enabling it to snatch the prey with impressive precision.
