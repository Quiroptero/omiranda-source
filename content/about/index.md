# Welcome to **The coding chiroptera's lore**!

This website is my personal coding journal where I document my learnings in Python and other technologies.
I'll be **[writing](/posts)** about my findings, challenges and things I have built.
You can find all the posts, grouped by year, in the **[/archive](/archive)**.

I wanted some descriptive analytics of the website,
so I added a **[/stats](/stats)** page.

I keep track of features to be implemented and bugs to be crushed in
**[the repository](https://github.com/Quiroptero/omiranda-source/issues)**.

Finally, this website hadn't been possible without all the things I have learned from cool
(and sometimes anonymous) people out there.
To all of them, **[/thank-you](/thank-you)**.

# About me

I'm Osvaldo Miranda, a curiosity-driven learner currently working in the Data Engineering field.

While my main interest is Python,
I have also taken a dive on several other technologies,
including [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is the framework I use to build this site.

I have a list of things that I use in my **[/uses](/uses)** page
and a collection of websites that I like to read in my **[/blogroll](/blogroll)**.

All my projects are repositories listed in my **[GitHub profile](https://github.com/Quiroptero)**.
Although I don't like the platform, I have a **[LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omiranda-dev/)**.
If you want a more **detailed and formal CV**, you can check it out **[here](https://omiranda.dev/cv)**.

**Wait, what does "chiroptera" mean?**

_Chiroptera_ is the scientific order that comprises bats.
I love bats, they are fantastic animals that make the world a better place.
There are a lot of cool facts about bats flying around this website, have you spotted them already?
