# About me

I'm Osvaldo Miranda, a curiosity-driven learner 
that some time ago got caught up by the idea of having a personal website.
I now have four of them.

In the tech side of things I lean towards automating stuff.
I'm interested in open source, Python and in general DIY-ish projects, of which this site is an example.
