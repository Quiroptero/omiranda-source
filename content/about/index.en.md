I like writing and coding —and I'm always learning something new by doing that.

This website will be a place for me to talk about that process and to share my findings to anyone that might be interested. How-to tutorials, code snippets, python programming, rationales and random thoughts on tech stuff —all of that will live here.

I decided to build this little corner of the Internet despite the fact that I already have a personal blog. The main reason is that although that blog helps me to quench my writing thirst, its purpose is broad and foggy, not tech-focused. If you want to take a look at it, [here it is](https://quiroptero.blog) (Spanish only).

For this website I have decided to post in both English and Spanish and I'll be posting here with no defined periodicity, but I'll do my best to do it at least once a month. Let's see what happens!

You can find the source code of this website [in this repo](https://github.com/Quiroptero/source.omiranda.dev) and the actual rendered files [over here](https://github.com/Quiroptero/omiranda.dev).
